# CUB3D
Project Cub3d for 42 Paris school

THIS IS NOT THE FINAL VERSION, WAIT FOR IT ðŸ‘€
but..
If you're from school 42, and you wanna play with your friends in a LAN party, you must follow these steps:

- Download the repo and get inside it
- make bonus
- run : ./cub3D_bonus multi.cub
- Click on MULTI -> if you're the HOST, obviously click on host, an IP might appear on the top, share it with your friend(s).
                 -> if you're joining, click on join, write the IP your HOST gave you, write a pseudo then RETURN
- When everybody is in a team, use the arrows to change team, you should be able to launch the game.

HAVE FUN, AND PLEASE WAIT FOR THE FINAL VERSION.
